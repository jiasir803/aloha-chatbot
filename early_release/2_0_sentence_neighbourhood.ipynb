    "## Utilities for model inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why\n",
    "\n",
    "The model requires to be manually inspected. This is due to in semi-supervised setting, accuracy may not be an good indicator of learning, due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* model accuracy depends on how data setup. Due to it indicate roughly: \"how well the model is guessing the data correctly\".\n",
    "* How data should be setup is exactly what we want to investigate. Therefore based on the last point, the question is circular and can not be solved. Only thing we can do is to manually inspect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the inspection want to answer all of the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How good is each variations of the model learning? In details, what exactly does it learn? To take apart this question, in details, we want to ask:\n",
    "    * What exactly does the variations of the model care about? Is it sentence structure (syntactic), content (sematic), or something else?\n",
    "    * If it is learning something useful, how does it help us normalize data?\n",
    "    * How well is the variation of the model learning, for whatever it is learning?\n",
    "* In terms of clustering, what is the optimal sum of determine if it should be centrality?\n",
    "    * Can median / avg be an good indicator for centrality?\n",
    "* In terms of the sentence characteristic (simple vs complex sentence, special structure or meanings...) what does sum / avg be good at indicate them?\n",
    "* What exactly determine a good ranking, or a good confidence value? E.g., if sentence 1 against sentence 2 has confidence of 0.8, and rank 90, what does it mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspection code follows procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* random draw n=40 (called sample_n) sentences from dataset.\n",
    "* for each drawed sentences, retrive t=10,000 (called top_n) top ranked result against the sentence. Keep confidence and rank value.\n",
    "* manual inspect (program print out) some samples of the ranked sentences:\n",
    "    * Sentence will be sampled by rank ranges, for each range random draw 2 samples from them:\n",
    "        * [R1] 1-10\n",
    "        * [R2] 10-20\n",
    "        * [R3] 20-30\n",
    "        * [R4] 30-60\n",
    "        * [R5] 60-120\n",
    "        * [R6] 120-300\n",
    "        * [R7] 300-600\n",
    "        * [R8] 600-1000\n",
    "        * [R9] 1000-4000\n",
    "* In addition, all drawed sentence will be print out by its average and sum of top 10,000 value, this value is changeable, we call the value accepable_rank. (Note: the value can not be bigger than 10,000 due to it is based on the last calcuated result)."
